## Debugging

After starting the app with `npm run dev:debug`, you've two options:

1. For in-editor debug with VSCode, configuration already included in `.vscode/launch.json`. It will attach the debbuger to the running process.
2. You can look at `chrome://inspect` to open a debugger panel using Google Chrome DevTools.
